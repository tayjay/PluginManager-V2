This plugin adds an easy to use command system to automatically install and update plugins for SCP:SL.

This is not a new idea, but is a rewrite of LocalAdmin's built-in PluginManager system which has not been updated to LabAPI.

This plugin supports both LabAPI and EXILED plugins.

WIP, not released yet.
